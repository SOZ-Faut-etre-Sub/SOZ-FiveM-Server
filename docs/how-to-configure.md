# IntelliJ IDEA

Be sure to configure your eslint plugin to use "Automatic ESLint configuration" and "Run eslint --fix on save" options,
so that the soz-core and soz-phone projects are formatted correctly.

Also the file ending are in LF format, please configure your IDE to use LF instead of CRLF but also your git client.
