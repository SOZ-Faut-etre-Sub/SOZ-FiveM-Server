# NPWD Release (Current version 1.0)

**New-Phone-Who-Dis** (*NPWD*) is a standalone and open source phone resource created for use in [*FiveM*](https://fivem.net/). It was built from 
the ground up by some of the previous contributors and maintainers of the Reignited GCPhone project, who found
the Vue 2 codebase littered with technical debt and legacy code that hindered continued development.

*NPWD* is an attempt at solving these problems and making a codebase that can be adapted and extended on
by the community. Maintainability has been our utmost priority as well. It has been designed to be as developer accessible as possible, with included utilities and tools
to ease and streamline the phone development process.

**Important Note:** This release(v1.0) should be considered a beta release and may experience edge case issues
with some frameworks and environments. Please ensure you report these issues as described below.

## Standalone Information & Installation

We have designed *NPWD* to be generally framework agnostic, meaning that it can easily be 
integrated with both popular open source frameworks like ESX & QBCore or any arbitary 
custom framework. 

For further details on this system, please refer to our installation [documentation](https://projecterror.dev/docs/npwd/start/installation).

**As of 1/6/2021, you must use our fork of [screenshot-basic](https://github.com/project-error/screenshot-basic)

## Technical Stack and Development

*NPWD* uses React + TypeScript to form the NUI front end and uses TypeScript (V8 runtime) for game 
scripts. You can find more technical information regarding the development of this project on our docs 
page [here](https://projecterror.dev/docs/npwd/dev/dev_bootstrap).
