# Contributing to New Phone Who Dis

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` or `develop`.
2. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Semantic Versioning

NPWD follows semantic versioning. We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for
new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes.

## Any contributions you make will be under the CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0 License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [CC-BY-NC-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/project-error/npwd/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Craig Hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408), a prominent app developer.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

These guidelines have also been adapted from [Facebook's Guidelines](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/a9316a723f9e918afde44dea68b5f9f39b7d9b00/CONTRIBUTING.md)

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Run `yarn format` for unification of styling across the project.
