// NPWD ocassionally can have a complex dependency graph in regards to async calls to the server
// In this example, we have an atom with name "example", with a async selector as the default value.

// In recoil, this means that the async selector will be immediately called upon the first 'get' attempt for the atoms state.
// The handler async function will execute only this one time, and once it resolves. This will never again be called until the atom is reset (NPWD will
// handle globally unloading all Recoil selectors and clearing their respective caches through the RecoilManager component when the
// character context changes)

// Since our selector returns a pending React suspense compatible promise, we need to utilize the Recoil.Suspense element
// in a component higher up in the component tree to correctly handle the promise pending state.

// tldr; THE SELECTOR WILL ONLY EVALUATE ONCE YOU FIRST REQUEST IT THROUGH a useRecoilState derived hook
